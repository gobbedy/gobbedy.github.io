The 5-year chart looks abysmal. They peaked at about $120 in April 2021. Before this, on the 10-year chart (not shown bc the app says only 1 pic allowed per post), you can see long term stability (with moderate fluctuations that usually served as excellent buying opportunities).  Since April 2021, the stock has fallen to 1/6th of that value, now beneath $19/share.  If they were ever to rebound—and that’s a BIG IF—that would be up to a 6-fold gain. 

They have a new CEO since the first one looted the company and drove it into the ground. 

They canceled their excellent dividends, which was my incentive to remain holding shares. The stock has tanked 20% since they’ve done this (and that was fast, about 1 month). 

They are closing stores, I think about 5% of them. 

They bought Del Taco in 2022 and are looking to sell it in 2025 for a few hundred million in losses. 

That all sounds bad, but supposedly the reason they lost so much value is because they took on so much debt.  And these measures are debt-reducing, supposedly. 

So it may be a long term play, but does it seem like a rebound is possible or likely?  

Or does it seem like it will keep dropping and potentially go bust?  If it keeps going downdowndown, is this not a great play for Puts?

There is still much territory in the US and abroad where JACK has not expanded. Comparing to McD and Burger King, both of which are available in all 50 States and in Europe/Americas, there is tons of room for growth. But playing it right is extremely hard apparently. I am sure there is loads of brand-refinement that they can do (eg White-washing the whole brand and hiring clean young people to be more like In-N-Out) but the new CEO would rather hire T-Pain to be a spokesperson. Yes, seriously, T-Pain in 2025.

Personally, I don’t think it is going back to $120.  But it could bounce back to $40 or even up to $70. 

- when rates finally drop, debt-heavy businesses will surge, this being a prime example. 
- when they offload Del Taco or make it profitable and swallow that $400 million loss, they’ll at least be on the road to recovery, even though that’s a lot of 99¢ tacos they’ll need to sell to recover. 
- when the Ukraine war ends, in general, that will be good for the entire market. Why?  I don’t know. But the market hated the start of the war, so I presume the opposite will happen when it ends. But the end seems to be nowhere in sight unfortunately.  

Any thoughts out there?

Worth buying shares?
Worth buying calls?
Worth buying puts?

My positions are shares, about 200 average at $55, which means now I can’t even afford their tacos.
