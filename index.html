Here is the sixth installment of the Kendu Info Journal Series v2. KENDU is a  Brandcoin propelled by the strongest community in DeFi. “The Kendu community is filled with talent, passion, and conviction. It is a community that is running it up old school, 2021-style. We are a sentient, autonomous, ever-expanding marketing machine that will not rest.

Join the movement! How will you use your unique set of skills and networks to build the biggest brand and legacy in #web3?” (Kojak797 OG Loyalist and one of the prominent voices welcoming me to Kendu and talking in a VC in my early days)

Here and now, I believe Kendu is in a spectacular position in the market. I have been putting together these articles, which are a collection of the growing engagement and conversions of various CT crypto enthusiasts, with both massive to smaller followings, as a way to showcase the success of our organic approach. Please be advised that people are noticing, and growth will continue. As we continue to move up in MC and grow, more and more people will activate, be they new members, those reactivating, or those coming back and getting a bag again.

Point #3: EXPOSURE HELPS ORGANIC projects reach **critical mass**. With a low market cap, IRL growth and Social mentions spiking exponentially, holder count going up, creators posting with us up, and output rivaling communities with much larger MCs, Kendu is building towards greatness!

This brings me to my point: $KENDU will continue to keep growing organically, where holders will keep going up as the output of the Chads and Chadettes keeps increasing. **It is time to stop flipping for pennies when you can work towards the chance for generational wealth**. 

https://preview.redd.it/ox6981667i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80d7d7b6c25cdf516fa54be3b6df1013539bd2b4

$Kendu is getting increasingly noticed, and this series aims to prove our conversion powers. Altsteinn has eighty-three thousand followers and has been posting about Kendu since 2024, but combing through the profile, anyone can see an exponential increase in the shoutouts featuring us. Topics range from positivity about our whales DCAing to us being the goat, to the above post recognizing our brand and cult like nature. Anyone can label themselves anything, but living your brand is what matters: actions speak louder than words. 

It can start with a simple post, but when you see the movement spreading, pay attention! I start collecting posts the second I publish the previous article. While ordering this article, I noticed something IMPORTANT:

https://preview.redd.it/7aovcmg77i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=204d8353723661d345d2a24c12287859979c0413

https://preview.redd.it/bmb7eoz77i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4fec57baebe78381a6f8692580542d0eb9e9155

rekt\_cooked quoted one of  altsteinn ‘s previous posts. Bullish

Then primeblue99 quotes one of rekt\_cooked’s previous posts

https://preview.redd.it/amxoprf97i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19c9566a7178e110bdf69674a4e69bf40db34a72

And then it continues here with moriarty\_winn quoting the previous shoutout below:

https://preview.redd.it/vsspfdka7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0319edcae0ea1929f3b66ae81574ba1a8fc51070

The content of the posts should be studied! Remember, in Kendu, there are no paid KOLs with supply. Don’t panic, it is all organic!

Kojak797 already told readers, Kendu is running it up old school 2021 style, and it is working.

https://preview.redd.it/i8bzqr3d7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec22905df847f6f18f1fd11aa362c6eaac9570fd

Tokens can’t fake organic. Tokens can’t fake real. Tokens can’t fake having a movement. People are taking noticing and watching us like Anon\_1000X. Kendu is as real as it comes, and we are spreading our Brandoin everywhere!

So, what do people find appealing about Kendu? Maybe it is the Ken-Du attitude:

https://preview.redd.it/i4rp2d0e7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=027e7d4ca1397323662c8bef28062958d37b5860

As cryptomalli asserts in the energy that Kendu brings, all humans could use such an approach in their lives.

Maybe people like us because of the drive to win. Nothing can stop what we are building, and we won’t be stopped. We may not win every poll, but it is the expectation in our community that we should. With cryptonownever, Kendu showed up to Caden’s poll, and we won:

https://preview.redd.it/h8hd653f7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14bdf2be6e8716dcc50b5d594a0c177d6371362c

From that win, it resulted in a video was made about Kendu. Don’t take my word for it, watch Caden yourself. His 12.8K subscribers on YouTube must be nothing.

5iveall sent out the above post about Kendu. Only in the second post, and they already know what we are about. More posts have followed because once you get it, Kendu is part of you. Welcome and keep that helmet on!

CryptoSmallcap has 11.2K followers and is labeled as a Media and News Company. They have been posting about Kendu for months now, where we regularly land in their top ten. The profile does contain some posts that get at the heart and soul of Kendu, so worth checking out.

Time to get into some numbers. Gem\_Sheriff has a price expectation of 1 billion MC, but four days later, our old friend put a “Bull run target” of 5 billion MC. If you look at Gem’s profile, you can see that Kendu posts have been happening since the summer of ‘24. According to many, that is a low target for this cycle, but I agree that billions should be the easy minimum for Kendu to reach. Only work will get us there, and only time will tell. 

Why such conviction and belief? What do some say about Kendu?

I would encourage readers to check the profile themselves and decide if Kendu has fully converted another CT personality.

I just have to leave the above reply to my reply to cryptojourneyrs&#x27; post about ETH. He has one hundred and thirty-two thousand followers and is a well-known and respected crypto personality who is aware of Kendu.

At the time of writing, the post had 22.9 thousand views and 15.5 thousand listens. Additionally, Kendu is hosting a community space of our own at 5 pm EST today. (you can find it on X, 6/4/25)

Tune in or have a listen to learn more about Kendu.

Saving one of my favorites for last, Kenduraver is an OG loyalist in Kendu who has been around since the start. He took it upon himself to start the Kendu merch store around 5 million MC, and he co-founded KenduEnergy, our first true brandcoin product. This is the type of legend that works in Kendu, and he is one of the many reasons we are truly one of a kind!

No one can keep up with the output in Kendu as the work towards multi-billions is never-ending. And we are growing in important ways still. One such way is that the converts highlighted in previous articles are still posting about Kendu. That is what conversion is, they are now bull posting about Kendu since they got the vision. Now imagine what happens when some of those converts use the Kendu brand to build something on chain or off chain!

People who understand how markets work and what it takes for an organic project to be sustainable are shouting us out more and more and supporting Kendu with investment, both financially and with their time. These are people who understand what a movement is and are experienced traders.

Volume, holder count, and shoutouts will continue to rise, and MC will continue to stair-step up (it isn’t a straight line)! This is your invite to come, take a look, and see what is going on in Kendu because: We don’t gamble. We Work!

Here is the sixth installment of the Kendu Info Journal Series v2. KENDU is a  Brandcoin propelled by the strongest community in DeFi. “The Kendu community is filled with talent, passion, and conviction. It is a community that is running it up old school, 2021-style. We are a sentient, autonomous, ever-expanding marketing machine that will not rest.

Join the movement! How will you use your unique set of skills and networks to build the biggest brand and legacy in #web3?” (Kojak797 OG Loyalist and one of the prominent voices welcoming me to Kendu and talking in a VC in my early days)

Here and now, I believe Kendu is in a spectacular position in the market. I have been putting together these articles, which are a collection of the growing engagement and conversions of various CT crypto enthusiasts, with both massive to smaller followings, as a way to showcase the success of our organic approach. Please be advised that people are noticing, and growth will continue. As we continue to move up in MC and grow, more and more people will activate, be they new members, those reactivating, or those coming back and getting a bag again.

Point #3: EXPOSURE HELPS ORGANIC projects reach **critical mass**. With a low market cap, IRL growth and Social mentions spiking exponentially, holder count going up, creators posting with us up, and output rivaling communities with much larger MCs, Kendu is building towards greatness!

This brings me to my point: $KENDU will continue to keep growing organically, where holders will keep going up as the output of the Chads and Chadettes keeps increasing. **It is time to stop flipping for pennies when you can work towards the chance for generational wealth**. 

https://preview.redd.it/ox6981667i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80d7d7b6c25cdf516fa54be3b6df1013539bd2b4

$Kendu is getting increasingly noticed, and this series aims to prove our conversion powers. Altsteinn has eighty-three thousand followers and has been posting about Kendu since 2024, but combing through the profile, anyone can see an exponential increase in the shoutouts featuring us. Topics range from positivity about our whales DCAing to us being the goat, to the above post recognizing our brand and cult like nature. Anyone can label themselves anything, but living your brand is what matters: actions speak louder than words. 

It can start with a simple post, but when you see the movement spreading, pay attention! I start collecting posts the second I publish the previous article. While ordering this article, I noticed something IMPORTANT:

https://preview.redd.it/7aovcmg77i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=204d8353723661d345d2a24c12287859979c0413

rekt\_cooked quoted one of  altsteinn ‘s previous posts. Bullish

Then primeblue99 quotes one of rekt\_cooked’s previous posts

https://preview.redd.it/amxoprf97i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19c9566a7178e110bdf69674a4e69bf40db34a72

And then it continues here with moriarty\_winn quoting the previous shoutout below:

https://preview.redd.it/vsspfdka7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0319edcae0ea1929f3b66ae81574ba1a8fc51070

The content of the posts should be studied! Remember, in Kendu, there are no paid KOLs with supply. Don’t panic, it is all organic!

Kojak797 already told readers, Kendu is running it up old school 2021 style, and it is working.

https://preview.redd.it/i8bzqr3d7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec22905df847f6f18f1fd11aa362c6eaac9570fd

Tokens can’t fake organic. Tokens can’t fake real. Tokens can’t fake having a movement. People are taking noticing and watching us like Anon\_1000X. Kendu is as real as it comes, and we are spreading our Brandoin everywhere!

So, what do people find appealing about Kendu? Maybe it is the Ken-Du attitude:

https://preview.redd.it/i4rp2d0e7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=027e7d4ca1397323662c8bef28062958d37b5860

As cryptomalli asserts in the energy that Kendu brings, all humans could use such an approach in their lives.

Maybe people like us because of the drive to win. Nothing can stop what we are building, and we won’t be stopped. We may not win every poll, but it is the expectation in our community that we should. With cryptonownever, Kendu showed up to Caden’s poll, and we won:

https://preview.redd.it/h8hd653f7i5f1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14bdf2be6e8716dcc50b5d594a0c177d6371362c

From that win, it resulted in a video was made about Kendu. Don’t take my word for it, watch Caden yourself. His 12.8K subscribers on YouTube must be nothing.
